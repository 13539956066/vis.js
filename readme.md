#vis

vis is a visualizer for music files written in Javascript and just a bit of PHP. Additional technologies utilized are
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [three.js](http://threejs.org/). The visualizer itself is inspired by the
[Monstercat](https://youtube.com/Monstercat) visualizer.

Based on [Leafcat/vis](https://github.com/Leafcat/vis). Original project by [ix](https://github.com/ix).
