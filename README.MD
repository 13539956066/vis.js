#vis

vis is a visualizer for music files. It is written in pure javascript, using a bit of jQuery just for comfort. It is
inspired by the [Monstercat Visualizer](http://youtube.com/Monstercat).

It is merely a boilerplate. Feel free to use it in your projects, but credit me please.

vis is maintained by me, [@ix](http://github.com/ix).

Note: This particular fork makes a few changes to the look of the visualizer as well as the mechanism used to load
music. It expands the width of the visualizer, increases the time interpolation, interpolates the bars in relation to
their neighbors, and makes it easier to add new music for use. This fork uses PHP, a technology not utilized by the
original codebase.
